\title{
Visualise microarray and RNAseq data with gene ontology annotations.
}

\description{
Combines local gene expression data with online Gene Ontology (GO) resources
to visualise and rank ontologies enriched for genes best clustering
predefined groups of samples based on gene expression levels. Using the
\code{biomaRt} package, \code{GOexpress} semi-automatically retrieves gene
ontology annotations from Ensembl for the species corresponding to the
expression dataset prior to performing the analysis. A random forest analysis
is performed to evaluate the ability of each gene to cluster samples
according to a predefined grouping factor (one-way ANOVA available as an
alteranative). Each GO term is scored and ranked according to the average
rank (alternatively, average power) of all associated genes to cluster the
samples according to the factor. The ranked list of GO terms is returned,
with tools allowing to visualise the statistics on a gene- and ontology-basis.

    This package requires only two input variables
    \enumerate{
    \item An ExpressionSet containing assayData and phenoData. The former
    should be a gene-by-sample matrix providing gene expression values for
    each gene in each sample. The latter should be an AnnotatedDataFrame from
    the Biobase package providing phenotypic information and grouping factors
    with two or more levels.
    \item The name of the grouping factor to investigate, which must be a
    valid column name in the phenoData.
    }
    Following analysis, visualisation methods include:
    \itemize{
    \item Histogram and quantiles representations of the scores of GO terms
    \item Filtering of results on various criteria (e.g. number of genes
    annotated to GO term)
    \item Re-ordering of GO terms and gene result tables based on score or
    rank metric
    \item Table of statistics for genes annotated to a given GO term
    \item Hierarchical clustering of samples based on the expression level of
    genes annotated to a given GO term
    \item Heatmap of samples and genes based on the expression level of genes
    annotated to a given GO term
    \item Expression profile of a gene against one given factor (e.g. Time)
    while grouping samples on another given factor (e.g. Treatment)
    \item Univariate analysis of the expression level of a gene in the
    different groups of each experimental factor.
    \item Venn diagram of the counts of genes shared between a list of GO
    terms.
